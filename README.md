# rubiks

This is a Rubik's Cube application I am developing to learn/practice OpenGL.

Much of the OpenGL code is adapted from a tutorial made by 'thebennybox':

The OBJ loading functionality implemented in obj_loader.cc and obj_loader.h is
taken directly from sample code associated with the same tutorial:

Image loading is handled by the stb_image API:
